# Containers solutions 

Software can be deployed in virtual operating systems called containers, which are isolated bundles with their own software, libraries, and configuration files. These containers can communicate across each other and cen be easily deployed with controlled environments, removing many issues that occur when unknown variables and software on servers interact and clash with other software. Due to the controlled and easily replicable nature of containers, they come in handy when setting up applications across many, different platforms with varying degrees of resources and operating systems, software, and hardware, because as long as the platform can run Docker or similar container-based platforms, the containers are simple to set up.
