## NoSql database

Firebase offers two types of databases, from [the docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rtdb-vs-firestore)(which also helps you to pick):

- Cloud Firestore is Firebase's newest database for mobile app development. It builds on the successes of the Realtime Database with a new, more intuitive data model. Cloud Firestore also features richer, faster queries and scales further than the Realtime Database.
- Realtime Database is Firebase's original database. It's an efficient, low-latency solution for mobile apps that require synced states across clients in realtime.
